abstract = {We survey and extend the results on the complexity of machine scheduling problems. After a brief review of the central concept of NP-completeness we give a classification of scheduling problems on single, different and identical machines and study the influence of various parameters on their complexity. The problems for which a polynomial-bounded algorithm is available are listed and NP-completeness is established for a large number of other machine scheduling problems. We finally discuss some questions that remain unanswered.}
